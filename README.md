## Input Data Policy
Please note that the input data required to benchmark or run the files in this repository is not publicly available directly from the repository due to [this request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/).

To benchmark or run the files, follow these steps:

1. Acquire the Input Data:
   - You will need to obtain the required input data from the [appropriate sources](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

2. Create Input Files:
   - Once you have obtained the input data, create an `input.txt` file for each folder corresponding to the specific day.
   - Ensure that the `input.txt` file is correctly formatted with the necessary input data.

3. Running the Code:
   - With the `input.txt` files in place, you can now use the provided code to benchmark or run the code.
